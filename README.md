# 🧠 DSA Preparation

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms preparation repository!
This repo is structured around mastering DSA concepts through problem-solving patterns, active recall, spaced repetition, and intuitive understanding.

🎯 Goal: Crack the MAANG Interview
🧭 Approach: Pattern-based + Brain-friendly learning
⏳ Time Budget per Question: 25–30 minutes

## 🧪 Learning Methodology

I don’t just solve problems. I understand them.

✅ Pattern-Based Thinking
✅ Active Recall & Teaching to Self
✅ Spaced Repetition of tricky concepts
✅ Mnemonics + Chunking
✅ Visualizing through Examples

## 🧠 Example Log

📘 Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Pattern: Variable-Sliding Window
Key Insight: Shrink window using a Set to remove duplicates
Mistake I made: Initially tried to track window by index instead of Set
Lesson: “Expand → Violate → Shrink → Resume”
